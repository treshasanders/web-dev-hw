            <b>CAPTION OVER: VIENNA</b></pre>

            <pre class="special">INT. AUSTRIA. VIENNA. ICE-CREAM PARLOUR - EVENING</pre>

            <pre>Sitting alone and upright at a small table is
              VILLANELLE.

              She neatly eats her ice cream.

              Sat at a table opposite are a MOTHER and YOUNG
              DAUGHTER.

              The YOUNG DAUGHTER sits eating ice cream while
              staring over at VILLANELLE, meanwhile her MOTHER
              sits quietly reading a magazine.

              VILLANELLE and the GIRL stare at each other for a
              moment. Both eating their ice creams.

              Eventually VILLANELLE smiles awkwardly at the YOUNG
              DAUGHTER.

              The YOUNG DAUGHTER does not smile back, but
              continues to stare suspiciously, shovelling ice-
              cream into her mouth.

              VILLANELLE stares back, put out by this reaction
              and her smile fades.

              She sees the YOUNG DAUGHTER move her gaze to the
              left and a huge chocolaty grin peels across the
              YOUNG DAUGHTER's face.

              Without turning her head, VILLANELLE’s gaze follows
              that of the YOUNG DAUGHTER and she sees a YOUNG MAN
              stood behind the counter grinning back at the YOUNG
              DAUGHTER.

              VILLANELLE observes the easy exchange: the dipping
              of the YOUNG MAN’s head, the crinkle of his eye,
              the kind, wide smile.

              She turns back to the YOUNG DAUGHTER and smiles at
              her again, but this time identically mimicking the
              dipping of the YOUNG MAN's head, the crinkle of his
              eye, the kind, wide smile.
