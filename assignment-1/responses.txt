I just returned from presenting a scientific paper at the annual meeting of the American Meteorological Society in Phoenix, Arizona, on Jan. 8. My paper focused on the first point. It shows our CO2 emissions have so little effect on atmospheric CO2 that our CO2 emissions cannot possibly cause climate change.

About 80 percent of the reviewing scientists agreed with my paper. Ten percent said they would think about it. No one rejected my paper. In addition, many climate scientists worldwide support my paper.
