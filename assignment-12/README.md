1. My imaginary client is Hempies, a made-up hemp seed brownie startup. They needed a simple site with easy navigation and a solid color palette and typography.

2. What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block? display: block places elements in beneath previous elements so 'blocks' are stacked linearly. display: inline, removes the stacking so elements sit right next to the previous element, flowing into a new line only if too many elements are added to fit in one line. display: inline-block is the same as display: inline except that it has to follow margin and vertical spacing rules.

3. Everything was fun and fine but I had a really hard time getting the fonts to work. That was very frustrating.
