1. Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do the serve? Most forms I see are a simple email form to subscribe to something. Online stores may also ask for email and offer a discount in return. Businesses love snatching those emails. It allows them to send you deals, new products, whatever keeps them in your inbox so you don't forget about them. Another I'll see is satisfactory surveys. Like a quick pop up that might have you rate you're experience on the site. That gives the web designer an idea of how easy the site is to navigate, user experience, etc.

2. An obvious example where a site would use text, selection, and buttons is to checkout an online cart. A user has text input for name, address, card info. They could select type of card, what state they're in maybe. And then a button to submit the order.

3. I like to do the framework first. So I add the main elements (head, body), then add the framework within each (meta, style, title for head, headings, address, forms, etc for body), and then I fill it in. I add comments above each block.
