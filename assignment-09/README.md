1. The universal selector allows html to be styled. The element selector selects like elements that are a certain kind. The class selectors select elements that are all the same function.

2. I found an image that I really liked for a background so I sampled colors from it to use. My colors are pink (#f6b1c4), yellow (#fdf473), and white (#ffffff). They're bright colors that fit with the 80s theme.

3. This assignment was challenging but I had a lot of fun playing around the css getting everything closer to what I want.
