1. I've been working with HTML for almost 10 years now. It's simple and gets the job done!

2. Keeping styling in a separate file is so so nice. As you can see in this assignment, a lot of styling had to be copied over between files to have a seamless website. With a separate file, things are much simpler.

3. Working with the color palette I chose was FUN. I really like warm tones so that melon/salmon color was fantastic.
