      <h3> Assignment Description</h3>

      <p>The intention of this assignment was to illustrate the power of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) by first creating a Web blog, and then creating 2 different style sheets for the blog that illustrate vastly different designs. The goal of each of the style sheets I created was to illustrate how different the design of my blog can be simply by changing and linking to different style sheets. The grade depended largely on how stark I made this illustration, while simultaneously keeping my site aesthetically pleasing and usable. My style sheets were to incorporate the elements we had been studying at that time, including:  color, backgrounds, images, background-position, background-attachment, background shorthand property, multiple background images, borders and margins.</p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>

      <p>I had a lot of fun with this assingment. I wanted to create a blog that portrayed a very oppositional experience depending on which stylesheet was applied to the blog content page (HTML). I decided I could execute this with a clown blog because though clowns bring joy to many (So I've heard) there are also many who actually fear them. It was really fun exploring the pantheon of possible stylesheets I could create while working on this assignment. For the first stylesheet, I decided to have it be bright and cheeful. The second was dark and menacing. I used every element of what we'd been learning in class to make the two blogs as unique from each other as I could and I'm proud of what I accomplished.
