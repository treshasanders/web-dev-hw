      <h3>Project Description</h3>

      <p>This summer I met a guy named Taylor Woods who works with Lolo Peak Brewing Company. We started talking about my experience with web and graphic design and he told me that Lolo Peak was releasing a new seasonal craft beer called "Caver Ale". He said that they didn't currently have a logo for it and if I submitted one and they liked it, they might choose mine before consulting with their usual graphic designer. As a competitive person and young adult interested in adding to my resume, I was excited to attempt to create a design that would be used to represent a craft beer.</p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>

      <p>This was my first major graphic design project in years. I was rusty with Adobe Photoshop but quickly remembered and relearned the knowledge I'd obtained years earlier. I had to research caves and observe many pictures of caves and cavers to really recreate a cave and caver in the logo. I also studied previous logos for other beers at the brewery to not create an outlier from the menu logos. I only used colors used in other logos. I did my best to match the aesthetic as well. I am very proud of the final logo design and so happy to say that Lolo Peak Brewing Company chose my design and had it on their menu for the seasonal Cherry Scotch Caver Ale.</p>
