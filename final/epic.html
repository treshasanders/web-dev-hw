      <h3>Project Description</h3>

      <p>The University of Montana EPIC Pitch Competition is run by the College of Business and the Blackstone LaunchPad. The competition is open to all students of the University of Montana including Missoula College, regardless of year or major. The goal of the competition is to courage innovative and creative thinking. This is an opportunity to present exciting ideas for new businesses or social entrepreneurship ventures and win money and prizes as well as market a startup to the interested public.</p>

      <p>As the Graphic Designer for Blackstone LaunchPad, I was asked to make a poster to obtain student interest, a poster to obtain public interest, as well as facebook and moodle designs for advertising the event.</p>


      <h3>What I Learned</h3>

      <p>This felt like my first real project as a Graphic Designer. My projects before were a part of other administrative jobs as well as freelance work. As recently hired Graphic Designer, I learned time management, working without supervision, communication primarily through email, how to take conflicting constructive criticism and use that to create a design that pleases the majority, and more.</p>
