      <h3>Assignment Description</h3>

      <p>The entire class was this project. We were to be put in groups of 4 and create a website based on a client's needs. The clients were owners of a small gym in Missoula and their needs for the site included, user profiles and log-ins, a scheduling algorithm for athletes, and social media incorporation. We were allowed to use whatever language we decided. We were to track our progress in a Gantt chart and present our website for the final.

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>

      <p>My focus in Computer Science has been front-end user interaction so I my responsibility was moreso with the front-end aspect of the website. After the first two weeks of class a member of our team dropped the class so that was a setback. The two guys left in my group felt like Ruby on Rails was our best option for the back-end of our site. None of us had used the language before and we quickly learned that it was not going to be as simple to use as we had originally thought. Getting the programs to execute exactly what we wanted to proved to be incredibly difficult. Getting the the back-end to work with the front-end also proved to be almost impossible as Ruby on Rails innately formats itself. Trying to force it to fit the visual we wanted was a major challenge.
