1. There should only be one head element and one body element. the head element is the information about the page while the body is the content of the page.

2. Structural markup represents the layout of page. This includes headings, paragraphs, breaks, etc. Semantic markup is used to further explain or represent the information in the document. This could include strong elements, emphasis, etc. These are represented with tags within the structural markup tags.

3. This assignment was great. It feels like we're really starting to build full web pages. Commenting is important. And semantic markup is necessary to me to avoid a web page that looks flat and basic.
